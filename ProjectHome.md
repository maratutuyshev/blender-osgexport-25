This is a rewrite of the osgexport script from Blender 2.49. This is a completely different script to the original. It currently supports models, armatures and animation. It is getting pretty good.

Note: The exporter from Cedric Pinson (https://github.com/cedricpinson/osgexport) will be the best script to use once it supports animation. The purpose of this script is as a stop gap and to give Cedric some example code to pinch when he updates his script.
